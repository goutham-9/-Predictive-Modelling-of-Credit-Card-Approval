In this project, we focussed on developing a model to predict credit card approvals accurately and efficiently. It employs logistic regression, a statistical method, to analyze various demographic and financial factors that influence credit card approval decisions. The goal is to improve the fairness and speed of the credit card approval process, thereby aiding financial institutions in making more informed decisions and promoting financial inclusion. The project also emphasizes the importance of data cleaning, preprocessing, and the use of statistical analysis techniques like ANOVA and Chi-Square tests for a comprehensive understanding of the data. Through detailed data visualization, the project offers insights into the patterns and trends within the credit card approval process, highlighting areas for improvement and potential biases in current practices.
